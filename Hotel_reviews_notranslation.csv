The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent.

We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well.

Everything looked fine UNTIL my 3 year old son was wearing black shorts and socks and had sat on the floor only to get up and have his whole bottom and socks covered in WHITE FUR. I turned on all the lights and DISCOVERED that the carpet was covered in what seemed to be dog or cat fur, my mother in law and I looked at each other and noticed our clothes were covered in it too as well as our luggage. Once again I went downstairs as we were leaving for dinner asking the front desk if there was anyway to send someone to at least vacuum the room or to get me the vacuum so I do it, she said house keeping was gone and they could possibly send me one when I came back. I didn't get the vacuum and the next morning my mother in law woke up with a SWOLLEN face and itchy throat (she is MILDLY ALLERGIC to animal fur but thats how much fur was in the room that it caused her to have a SEVERE allergic reaction).

When I called to have maintenance come up (at approx 9:30pm) to unclog the toilet, I was told that there was no one there to do that for me and that I could come down to the front desk and get the plunger to handle myself. I was told most guests prefer to do this themselves because they do not want strangers in their room. Really I'm on vacation - clearly that wasn't something that was on my must do list. I asked about changing rooms and was told they were sold out. I'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was clearly not full. With 3 children and it being 10pm at this point, finding a new hotel wasn't really an option. After being handed a plunger and extra towels I unclogged my own toilet and then proceeded to act as Certfied Plumber two more times that night and the next morning. Breakfast the next morning was the one positive of this stay. I never spoke to the manager - when I went to the desk in the morning to voice my concerns I was told she was on a conference call.

I don't really tolerate hair in a clean hotel room, but I threw it away and let it go. When I was helping my daughter wash her hands soon after, the soap dispenser on the wall fell, and then I could tell the bathroom counter and sink were not cleaned, and there was more hair in the sink. The kids were excited to swim, so we ignored this mess and went to the pool. The pool was fine, but the hot tub was very murky. After swimming, we went back to the room and when I pulled the covers down in the bed, there were 2 more hairs. It was late, and we were tired, so I cleaned them up. In the morning, when I opened the shower curtain to take a shower, there was hair hanging from the shower faucet, and then from the towels! I couldn't handle anymore grossness, and we packed up and left. No one in my family got ready that morning, and there was no one one at the front desk to talk to. We skipped breakfast, because we were leary of how anything was really cleaned. I am extremely disappointed in this stay, as hair everywhere is not OK, not excusable.

The staff was pleasant upon check-in, but we were a bit disappointed with the old feeling of the room, lack of light in the shower, etc. We were out and about most of the afternoon and evening, and when I pulled back the covers to get in bed at about 11:30, a reddish-brown bug was trying to scurry out of sight. I caught it and confirmed in an online image search that it was indeed a bedbug. We tore up the covers and found another. Out of curiosity, we looked at the other bed in the room and didn't see any, but we did notice it was wrapped in a mattress cover that our bed didn't have...perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem (which obviously wasn't eradicated) We'd heard bedbug infestation horror stories so we packed everything up, called the night manager to tell her we would be seeking alternate accommodations and dropped our key in the slot. The night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning. The next morning my husband talked to the manager and although she was reluctant to give us a complete refund (citing Expedia fees, etc), she did agree and we received a refund. After returning home from our trip we called to request additional compensation for our trouble of leaving to find another (more expensive) hotel at midnight but not surprisingly didn't get a response.

We only stayed for one night and did not use the kitchen appliances but would not have used them for a longer stay as they seemed unclean. The carpet was stained and had runs in numerous places. The outside vanity area was ok but the interior of the bathroom was very bad. There was a large patch in the ceiling that the fiberglass webbing was still visible, it was not mudded and finished properly. The caulking around the tub was gross. It was obvious that the previous caulk was not removed or cleaned but that a new bead of caulk was placed over, poorly. The curtain rod was extremely loose and I was afraid to place my towel on it after showering as I was afraid it would fall. The tub fixtures were loose and the tub spout itself was at a 45 degree angle when we checked in. The bed and bedding were mediocre at best. Again, I was only in the room for a short time so I did not give the hotel an opportunity to rectify the problems but I feel any room that they may have moved me to would have had similar issues.

But that safety feature was blown out of the water because they prop the doors at both ends of the hallway open all day. The pool was dirty, but I didn't use it, but if I wanted to, I wouldn't have. In the morning there was a homeless person walking through the hallways and going through the garbage. The decor was old and worn (holes in the draperies), but it appeared passably clean. 2 soups, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, a make-up remover pacakge, Q-tips, and cotton balls were all provided. Breakfast was OK. Lots of pre-packaged food, but the eggs they advertised were obviously powdered--they were in the shape of squares! Cereal, muffins, bread, toaster, no peanut butter, boiled eggs, cheese slices (american), hot sausage and a waffle maker. So that was OK.

She took care of... Read More every little detail and allowed me to not stress one bit the day of the wedding. The venue is BEAUTIFUL. All of the out-of-state guests loved it, saying it was the most peaceful place with the nicest staff they have ever met. Everything from the rooms to the staff to the food was impeccable. As far as the wedding and reception - it was literally perfect (we even extended an hour). Nothing, nothing at all, went wrong that I am aware of. And if something did, Julie is so good she would have taken care of it without my knowing. She took care of all the little details that a bride forgets about, like putting purses and cell phones in a safe spot, holding my flowers on cue when needed, taking gifts back to our room, along with setting up rose petals and champagne on our bed without us knowing!

"13001","101 Lakeway Dr","Austin","US","Lakeway Resort & Spa","Lakeway",2016-07-30,"EVERY TIME I got to this hotel there are SIGNIFICANT INCOVENIENCES. This year, they did not give me the balcony room that I PREPAID for, and waited until check-in to tell me, so I had no options but to accept a room without one. AND, they did NOT offer any kind of compensation for that, nor did they ever apologize. Further, last year this hotel experienced a significant check-in process problem that kept me and my two toddlers without a room until 8pm (this also impacted about 100 guests). Within this, they issued me keys to two OCCUPIED rooms, so we walked in on people - terribly embarrassing, inconvenient, and UNSAFE. Again, no apologies or compensation offered. I wrote to the GM about this, and he begrudgingly comped one of our nights. Other issues - in general, the service is slow, uncoordinated, and unhelpful. People seem very polite but when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving, they aren't capable. It's like they aren't given the tools to do their jobs well and/or no one has really trained them - just a halfway (that's the nice term) approach to service is all you will see from the front desk and most other staff (except the spa which tends to be pretty awesome). Bottom line . . . the lake scenery and the spa are AMAZING. So, if you can dramatically lower your expectations about the hotel service level, you'll be fine. Otherwise, you to get a guest pass to the pool for the day, but stay in downtown Austin at night.","Service is TERRIBLE but view is AMAZING","Dana","en"

The manager was called and they were able to locate a room after about 30 minutes. The room that we were placed in had a toilet that was barely functional, was missing the TV remote, and most importantly, the door to the shared kitchenette area would not close.

To top it off, the bill was super expensive. The staff was very nice at the hotel and but for the food and location, it would have been a good stay. This was a Hilton by name only.

There were cigareties burns all over the jacuzzi, and my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it. The towels were old, dingy and brittle. The deadbolt on the front door didn't work. And,the patio do didn't have any kind of security lock, although the patio was adjacent to another room. Which meant if we had left our things there to go sightseeing, the people in the adjacent room could've easily broken into our room and stolen our things. To add insult to injury,the hotel charged my credit card twice and I had to call them about it and then wait days for them to return the other 172 that I clearly needed to pay for another hotel, since I was on vacation.

As a forewarning for anyone who might care, our room was definitely on the small side with only 2 full size beds rather than queen beds as is more typical in most hotels.","Reasonable price for a pleasant room","A Traveler","en"

A couple across the hall called the police, but the damage was already done. When the police arrived, the attackers scattered. Some were in rooms on our floor while others were not even guests of the hotel. There are no cameras, no security and a night manager who would rather not get involved.

It was a great place to crash for the night on our way down to FL. However - the surrounding location was, um, horrible. We didn't sleep well based on the fear of our car getting broken into. Conveniently there is a gas station right across the street so we could fill up and get drinks for the car ride the following day and there were strippers in the gas station maybe off duty for the night Broke a 20 and pretty sure we got wet crumpled stripper money back as change! Gross. We asked about food nearby because all that was close was fast food which we didn't want. We were told to drive down the road 10-15 min and there would be some sit down restaurants. I've never been so happy to see a Longhorn Steakhouse! After what felt like driving through the ghetto it was the place we were stopping without further exploring down the road. The hotel is a little outdated but can't blame them, the location doesn't scream new or getting a lot of people through town much.

When we booked the hotel it said it was the last one available, meaning that all their other rooms were taken. For a hotel that claims to be at full capacity and thus possibly doing well financially, the quality of their rooms is disgusting. We walked into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette. Nowhere on our booking did it say this was a smoking room. The bedroom furniture was all written on with permanent marker by someone named Chula, who was asking for money. The smoke detectors were broken and hanging from the wall. Some of the outlets you could tell had burned out because they were brown from the outside (we didn't use them.) The bathroom door had a hole in it, there was no toilet paper, or complimentary  soaps. The shower did not work!! Only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to kneel inside the tub to get any water. The chairs had the cushions fall out. When we finally when to sleep we almost thought there was bedbugs because we saw all these black spots, it turned out to be cigarette droppings. Like really?!

Unfortunately my car window was smashed during the night property was stolen. Mgmt alerted me to the break in and was polite and accommodating when asked for assistance. However I have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned. It took 3 attempts to get the police dept to respond. The 1st officer was sympathetic but explained there was nothing they could do. The 2nd officer was very short tempered and said that they simply did not have time to deal with minor crimes. The 3rd officer, who actually did come to the hotel, told me that I should not stay anywhere at that particular interchange due to the very high crime rate and that I should leave the area as soon as possible. I could not drive the car with my young son because of the amount of glass everywhere in the car. Because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm. This made for a long night of driving home after a very stressful day. Hotel staff was adamant that there was not room for me to stay an additional night and did not allow me to stay in our room past 3:00pm. We wound up camping out in the lobby. Hotel mgmt seemed to indicate that a room might be available. To be perfectly honest I could not stay another night at the hotel and expect to get any sleep.

The hotel honored the rate and the customer service was outstanding. I wasn't able to take advantage of most of the amenities, so I can't speak to the condition of the pool/whirlpool or continental breakfast. The room was very clean and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. (There's a 24-hour Walmart located next door so I was able to pick up any overnight items I needed there.) The small fridge in the room made a loud noise, but I was able to quiet it by sliding a thick piece of cardboard under one of the corners. My only criticism is that the mattress was much too firm for MY personal preference. (I have chronic lower back pain and own a Sleep Number bed, which I keep between 35 and 45 on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being maximum firmness.)

The laundry is on site including dryer and washer. This is the plus when I decided to book this property. My only complaints are the noises in the early morning when businesses load their goods and the hidden fee of cleaning service. It was indicated on the confirmation page that additional fee of 50 will be charged by the hotel at check in/out. However, the hotel only informs me at my arrival that I stay more than 3 nights, so the additional fee will be 130 instead of 50. I understand the whole resort/cleaning fee, and I do not mind to pay 130 if I am informed in advanced. I book hotels very frequent and I understand the resort fee usually bases on daily. If not, the property will inform the slum sum amount before customer decide to book or not. At castle kona reef, cleaning happens once a week, so we do not get room cleaning during our stay. Room is not fresh and clean by the end of the day. The kitchen has ants everywhere. The fridge is not extremely clean. Therefore, 130 is a bit too much. I am more than happy to know the fees in advance and decide whether or not staying is worth it. Compare to 5 stars hotel, the cleaning fee is a bit overprice.

"34837","1705 S State St","Big Rapids","US","Quality Inn and Suites Big Rapids","MI",2015-12-26,"Accessible room was a bit of a disappointment. The most important item needed was a comfort height toilet. The toilet was extremely low (probably not more than 15 high) and very difficult to use for someone with hip and knee problems. There was a grab bar, which was absolutely needed. There were brown water stains around the base of the toilet which gave the bathroom a very bad look. In addition there was a very glaring light in the bathroom and no place for a night light. Also did not like the fact that the room was in the back of the hotel in a separate building. Usually accessible rooms are located in the front of the hotel on the ground level. There was a bag of trash by the door where we entered our building and it was still there when we checked out the next day.","Good, reasonably priced.","Paul","en"

"34997","Calo Des Corral S/n","Ridgefield Park","US","Inturotel Esmeralda Park","NJ",2015-06-07,"This was our first holiday (flight and hotel stay) with our nearly 3 yrs old. From our point of view it was really good as their is plenty to do in and just outside of the hotel complex. The swimming pool had a seperate toddler pool and the larger pools also had a shallow end which was quite safe for them. We stayed in a deluxe room and was not disappointed. We stayed self catering so did not use the restaurant at all but talking to other guests it was ok. I had a look at the breakfast one morning and it looked good. The surrounding areas which are in easy walking distance had a great choice of bars and restaurant's and it was nice to walk out every evening to wander round. The shops were all pretty much what you would expect from a Spanish resort area (mostly gift shops) but there were plenty of small supermarkets dotted around so it was easy to just pop out on foot to get some supplies. The evening entertainment was quite good and the kids loved it. But I'm not sure I would have liked to be staying right next to it as it went on quite late and if you were trying to sleep a child it would be impossible. My only bad point was the pool area, far too small for the amount of guests and sunbeds they have. You had to navigate your way around as everyone was squashed in, and the stairs to the beach bar (which was good) was often semi blocked by sunbathers! Would I go back No, as nothing was excellent just good but dont get me wrong we really had a good time.","First summer holiday with toddler","Martin","en"
"35015","Calo Des Corral S/n","Ridgefield Park","US","Inturotel Esmeralda Park","NJ",2015-05-20,"Family-friendly location with a nice private beach. The hotel offers activities for all ages and our kids definitely loved it. They 'babysit' your kids for like 2 hours everytime they join an activity for example waterpolo, 'Detective Day', Mini-disco, etc. Accessible to a lot of restaurants, boutiques and Grocery. However, if you are expecting some peace and quiet, this is not the place for you. It can get really noisy during the wee hours of the morning. Another minus is that you need to pay for the amenities like billiards, pinball, game machines, etc. for the children and it can cost a lot if you sum it up. In total, we had a fun stay! Will come back again next time...","Fab family holiday","A Traveler","en"

I needed to extend my check-out time, and they gladly granted my request after they checked with Housekeeping and even though the room had a check-in customer later that day. They also gave me free valet parking for my handicap needs. I would recommend this hotel.

Swimming pool was too small,very disappointing since it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a night.The pool area was hot,suffocating,like sitting inside a sauna. Staff are not that friendly. It was ok in the beginning but when the A/c in our room started acting up at 2 am that's when my nightmare began. I called the front desk to complain about the A/C and she was nice enough to let us use the room across the hallway,went in there and it was freezing,couldn't adjust the temprature because the control knobs were missing. Tried to go back to sleep after a few hours a staff came in using his own key( he probably wasn't informed there were guests moved into that room),quite scary but he got out right away when he saw there were people in the room. After about an hour cleaning lady barged in-didn't know room was occupied. I planned that one night get away to cool down and relax but unfortunately it didn't happen in this hotel.
