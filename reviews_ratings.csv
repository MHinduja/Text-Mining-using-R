It's a no-frills place: No fitness center no vending machines as far as I could see balcony slide door lock didn't work, though there was a safety bar very small lobby housekeeping came after the first day and thereafter only to take old towels. And no dining or bar facility on site. But the hotel is up-front about all that, so no real penalty. Also, the hallway carpet was missing because it is being replaced, but hey, at least that means that they refresh the facilities every so often. Most importantly, though, the room itself was clean and quiet. And there is free breakfast. So take it for what it is: a clean, basic facility that will save you some money compared to most other hotels in the area.","stay hotel day frill place fitness center vend machine far can see balcony slide door lock didnt work though safety bar small lobby housekeeping come first day thereafter take old towel dine bar facility site hotel front real penalty also hallway carpet miss replace hey less mean refresh facility every often much importantly though room clean quiet free breakfast take clean basic facility will save money compare much hotel area",1,5

But that safety feature was blown out of the water because they prop the doors at both ends of the hallway open all day. The pool was dirty, but I didn't use it, but if I wanted to, I wouldn't have. In the morning there was a homeless person walking through the hallways and going through the garbage. The decor was old and worn (holes in the draperies), but it appeared passably clean. 2 soups, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, a make-up remover pacakge, Q-tips, and cotton balls were all provided. Breakfast was OK. Lots of pre-packaged food, but the eggs they advertised were obviously powdered--they were in the shape of squares! Cereal, muffins, bread, toaster, no peanut butter, boiled eggs, cheese slices (american), hot sausage and a waffle maker. So that was OK. At 167 with tax it's one of the cheaper places in Sunnyvale and if you're just there for the night because you have to go to family court down the street, it's OK.

Further, last year this hotel experienced a significant check-in process problem that kept me and my two toddlers without a room until 8pm (this also impacted about 100 guests). Within this, they issued me keys to two OCCUPIED rooms, so we walked in on people - terribly embarrassing, inconvenient, and UNSAFE. Again, no apologies or compensation offered. I wrote to the GM about this, and he begrudgingly comped one of our nights. Other issues - in general, the service is slow, uncoordinated, and unhelpful. People seem very polite but when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving, they aren't capable. It's like they aren't given the tools to do their jobs well and/or no one has really trained them - just a halfway (that's the nice term) approach to service is all you will see from the front desk and most other staff (except the spa which tends to be pretty awesome). Bottom line . . . the lake scenery and the spa are AMAZING. So, if you can dramatically lower your expectations about the hotel service level, you'll be fine.

It was a great place to crash for the night on our way down to FL. However - the surrounding location was, um, horrible. We didn't sleep well based on the fear of our car getting broken into. Conveniently there is a gas station right across the street so we could fill up and get drinks for the car ride the following day and there were strippers in the gas station maybe off duty for the night Broke a 20 and pretty sure we got wet crumpled stripper money back as change!

They did fix the problem, however because of the big tournament going on they had a number of rooms blocked, not my problem as I still should have gotten the room I booked and paid for. The pool area was terrible. The worst pool area I have ever been in in a hotel. They only had buffet food in the restaurant due to the tournament which was also terrible especially for the price. It was nice to be right there where the tournament was so we had no travel time to and from. I think the best thing about the whole experience was the valet staff. They were very proficient, kind, and polite. The manager however, even fixing our room issue, had the vibe of being very irritated at having to fix our room issues. The girls at the counter were nice, the ice machines on all floors and in the restaurant ran out of ice and they were quick to make sure we had some.

However, if you are expecting some peace and quiet, this is not the place for you. It can get really noisy during the wee hours of the morning. Another minus is that you need to pay for the amenities like billiards, pinball, game machines, etc. for the children and it can cost a lot if you sum it up. In total, we had a fun stay!
