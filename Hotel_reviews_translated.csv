The 3rd officer, who actually did come to the hotel, told me that I should not stay anywhere at that particular interchange due to the very high crime rate and that I should leave the area as soon as possible. I could not drive the car with my young son because of the amount of glass everywhere in the car. Because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm. This made for a long night of driving home after a very stressful day. Hotel staff was adamant that there was not room for me to stay an additional night and did not allow me to stay in our room past 3:00pm. We wound up camping out in the lobby. Hotel mgmt seemed to indicate that a room might be available. To be perfectly honest I could not stay another night at the hotel and expect to get any sleep. It was a scary situation that could have been much worse."

Bowl had been scrubbed but who knows the last time the bottom and around the toilet had been cleaned. Sheets had stains on them and the bed skirt was ripped badly and looked terrible. All the furniture just looked tossed in there just because it fit and there was a safe in the room but said, do not use so that seems pointless. There was only a TINY bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't enough enough to use for just Myself let alone 4 people. You could tell the room never seems to get a good clean. Just the standard bed change and replenish or towels and few condiments.The customer desk answered a personal phone call on her cell when she was signing us in. I would never stay at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night!"

Last minute booking so we could not stay closer to Yellowstone National Park. Glad we stayed here. Excellent customer service and comfy beds. Water pressure in the shower was really good. I say this as a Californian traveling to another state that doesn't have a drought issue it was good for a change. My wife forgot her shampoo and conditioner. We went to the front desk and asked for some. People at the desk were nice and gave us a couple extra ones. The Dominos Pizza around the corner was convenient we ordered from there both nights we stayed. However there are plenty of other food options around there. Wendy's is literally on the same lot as the hotel. Walmart across the street and hotel is right off of I-15.

Swimming pool was too small,very disappointing since it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a night.The pool area was hot,suffocating,like sitting inside a sauna. Staff are not that friendly. It was ok in the beginning but when the A/c in our room started acting up at 2 am that's when my nightmare began. I called the front desk to complain about the A/C and she was nice enough to let us use the room across the hallway,went in there and it was freezing,couldn't adjust the temprature because the control knobs were missing. Tried to go back to sleep after a few hours a staff came in using his own key( he probably wasn't informed there were guests moved into that room),quite scary but he got out right away when he saw there were people in the room. After about an hour cleaning lady barged in-didn't know room was occupied. I planned that one night get away to cool down and relax but unfortunately it didn't happen in this hotel.
